# ModalBox Highlighter

This CSS snippet is all about **improving focus and usability** when interacting with modal boxes in SilverBullet, such as search results, dialogs, or other pop-ups. Essentially, it’s a combination of **visual polish** and **functional enhancement**.

*   **Dimensions & Shape**: 600px wide, 80px from top, 15px rounded corners - modern, soft look.
*   **Backdrop**: Dark, semi-transparent, blurred overlay - focuses attention on modal.
*   **Benefits**: Improves focus, usability, and aesthetics with sleek, user-friendly design.


```space-style

/* Makes the modal box a little narrower and higher to fit more results*/
.sb-modal-box {
   /* width: 600px;*/
    top:80px;
    border-radius: 15px !important;
}
.sb-modal-box .sb-result-list {
    max-height: 60vh;
}

/* Creates a dark blured backdrop when a ModalBox is opened */
#sb-root::before {
  content: "";
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0; 
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(14px);
  z-index: 68;
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none; 
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

/*#sb-root:has(.sb-modal-box[open])::before,*/
#sb-root:has(.sb-modal-box)::before,
#sb-root:has(.sb-modal)::before
{
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: auto;
}

.sb-modal-box[open],
.sb-modal {
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 69;
}

```
